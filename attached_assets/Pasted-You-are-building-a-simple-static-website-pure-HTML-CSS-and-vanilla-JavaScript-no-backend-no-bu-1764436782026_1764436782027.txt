You are building a simple static website (pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript — no backend, no build tools) for a beauty salon / service business that books appointments using Square.

The visual style should be inspired by: https://www.rikrak.com/
- Clean, minimal, modern layout.
- Large centered hero with the brand name and a short descriptor underneath (similar to "RIK RAK" / "SALON | BOUTIQUE").
- Strong typography, plenty of white space, simple color palette (mostly white, black/dark gray, and one accent color).
- Clear “Book” / “Book Appointment” button in the hero area.
Do NOT copy any text from rikrak.com, only take inspiration from the layout, spacing, and overall style.

IMPORTANT: Use the TWO images that are already uploaded in the Replit Files panel as the main visual base:
- Use the first image as the main hero image or background on the Home section.
- Use the second image in another key section (for example About Us or Services) so the design feels cohesive.
- Assume their file names are "hero-image.jpg" and "about-image.jpg" (add comments telling the user to rename these if their actual filenames are different).

====================================
1) GENERAL STRUCTURE
====================================
- The site must be a static website that can be hosted on GitHub Pages or Replit with no server-side code.
- Use a single-page layout with navigation links that scroll to sections:
  - Home (main hero / landing section)
  - About Us
  - Services
  - Book Appointment
- Create a top navigation bar similar in simplicity to rikrak.com:
  - Logo/brand name on the left.
  - Nav links (Home, About, Services, Book) in the center or right.
  - Language toggle (EN / ES) on the right side.

====================================
2) LANGUAGE SWITCH (ENGLISH / SPANISH)
====================================
- At the top-right of the navbar, add a language switch: two buttons or chips labeled “EN” and “ES”.
- Default language: English.
- When user clicks ES, all visible text on the page should switch to Spanish.
- When user clicks EN, text switches back to English.
- Do NOT reload the page to change languages; use JavaScript to swap text dynamically.

Implementation:
- Put all text content (nav items, headings, paragraphs, button labels, section titles, descriptions, footer text, etc.) into a JavaScript translations object like:

  const translations = {
    en: {
      navHome: "Home",
      navAbout: "About Us",
      navServices: "Services",
      navBook: "Book Appointment",
      heroTitle: "Your Modern Beauty Destination",
      heroSubtitle: "Professional salon services in a relaxing, boutique-style space.",
      heroBookButton: "Book Appointment",
      aboutTitle: "About Us",
      aboutText: "We are a modern beauty salon offering personalized hair, beauty, and wellness services.",
      servicesTitle: "Services",
      servicesHair: "Haircut & Style",
      servicesHairDesc: "Customized cuts and blowouts tailored to your style.",
      servicesColor: "Color & Highlights",
      servicesColorDesc: "Professional color services with premium products.",
      servicesNails: "Manicure & Pedicure",
      servicesNailsDesc: "Complete nail care for hands and feet.",
      bookTitle: "Book Your Appointment",
      bookText: "Reserve your visit quickly and securely through our online booking system.",
      bookButtonMain: "Book with Square",
      footerAddress: "Miami, Florida",
      footerHours: "Open Tuesday to Sunday",
      ...
    },
    es: {
      navHome: "Inicio",
      navAbout: "Sobre nosotros",
      navServices: "Servicios",
      navBook: "Reservar cita",
      heroTitle: "Tu destino moderno de belleza",
      heroSubtitle: "Servicios profesionales de salón en un ambiente tipo boutique.",
      heroBookButton: "Reservar cita",
      aboutTitle: "Sobre nosotros",
      aboutText: "Somos un salón de belleza moderno que ofrece servicios personalizados de cabello, belleza y bienestar.",
      servicesTitle: "Servicios",
      servicesHair: "Corte y peinado",
      servicesHairDesc: "Cortes personalizados y peinados adaptados a tu estilo.",
      servicesColor: "Color y luces",
      servicesColorDesc: "Servicios de color profesionales con productos de alta calidad.",
      servicesNails: "Manicure y pedicure",
      servicesNailsDesc: "Cuidado completo de manos y pies.",
      bookTitle: "Reserva tu cita",
      bookText: "Reserva tu visita rápida y de forma segura a través de nuestro sistema de reservas en línea.",
      bookButtonMain: "Reservar con Square",
      footerAddress: "Miami, Florida",
      footerHours: "Abierto de martes a domingo",
      ...
    }
  };

- In HTML, use data attributes (data-i18n="heroTitle", data-i18n="aboutText", etc.) on every text element.
- In script.js, create a function setLanguage(lang) that:
  - Loops through all elements with [data-i18n].
  - Replaces the innerText with translations[lang][key].
- Optional: store the selected language in localStorage so the site remembers the user’s choice.

====================================
3) DESIGN & LAYOUT (INSPIRED BY RIKRAK.COM)
====================================
- Clean, modern header with:
  - Brand name in uppercase or strong typography on the left (e.g., "SALON NAME").
  - Navigation links (Home, About, Services, Book).
  - EN/ES language toggle on the right.
- Hero section:
  - Centered large title similar in feeling to "RIK RAK" but with our own brand text (do not copy).
  - A smaller subtitle underneath (e.g., “SALON | BOUTIQUE” style, but customized).
  - Prominent Book button centered or just below title.
  - Use the hero image ("hero-image.jpg") either as a background with overlay or as a large prominent image near the text.
- Use a mostly white background with black/dark text and a single accent color (e.g., a soft beige, blush, or gold) for buttons and highlights.
- Use subtle borders or lines and a lot of white space like rikrak.com for a boutique, upscale feel.
- Use responsive design so the site looks good on both desktop and mobile.

====================================
4) SECTIONS
====================================

HOME (Hero):
- Big brand/title (data-i18n="heroTitle").
- Subtitle (data-i18n="heroSubtitle").
- Primary CTA button: “Book Appointment” / “Reservar cita” (data-i18n="heroBookButton").
- Button links to a Square booking URL placeholder:
  href="https://squareup.com/appointments/book/YOUR_SQUARE_LINK"
- Add a comment in the code telling the user where to put their real Square link.

ABOUT US:
- Section title (data-i18n="aboutTitle").
- Paragraph describing the salon (data-i18n="aboutText").
- Include the second image ("about-image.jpg") in this section, either as a side image or background.
- Layout can be a two-column design on desktop (image on one side, text on the other) and stacked on mobile.

SERVICES:
- Section title (data-i18n="servicesTitle").
- 3–6 service “cards” styled similarly to simple blocks or columns:
  - Haircut & Style (servicesHair / servicesHairDesc)
  - Color & Highlights (servicesColor / servicesColorDesc)
  - Manicure & Pedicure (servicesNails / servicesNailsDesc)
  - You may add one or two more services with similar translation keys.
- Each card has a service name and short description, all supported by the translation object.

BOOK APPOINTMENT:
- Section title (data-i18n="bookTitle").
- Short explanatory text (data-i18n="bookText").
- Large main button (data-i18n="bookButtonMain") that links to the same Square URL as the hero button.
- Optional small note text about appointments being handled securely via Square.

FOOTER:
- Minimal footer with address and hours, inspired by rikrak.com:
  - For example:
    - Address line (data-i18n="footerAddress")
    - Hours line (data-i18n="footerHours")
  - Optional social media icons/links (Instagram, Facebook) with placeholders.

====================================
5) IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
====================================
Files:
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js

index.html:
- Includes:
  - <header> with nav, logo, and language toggle.
  - <main> with sections: Home, About, Services, Book.
  - <footer> with basic info.
- Use data-i18n attributes on all text elements that need translation.
- Use <img src="./hero-image.jpg"> and <img src="./about-image.jpg"> with descriptive alt text.
- Add comments explaining that if the uploaded filenames are different, the user should change the src values.

styles.css:
- Mobile-first responsive styling.
- Sticky or fixed header that stays at the top while scrolling.
- Simple, grid or flex-based layout for sections.
- Boutiquey, minimal styling inspired by rikrak.com: uppercase headings, generous spacing, thin dividers, and button styles that match the aesthetic.
- Rounded corners on buttons and service cards.
- Use a Google Font (like "Poppins", "Montserrat", or a similar modern sans-serif).

script.js:
- Define the translations object with all needed keys for EN and ES.
- On DOMContentLoaded, call setLanguage('en') by default.
- Add event listeners to the EN and ES buttons/toggle.
- Implement setLanguage(lang) to:
  - Find all elements with [data-i18n].
  - Read the key from data-i18n.
  - Set element.textContent = translations[lang][key].
- Optional: save selected language to localStorage and apply it on page load if present.

====================================
6) CLEAN, COMMENTED CODE
====================================
- Add clear comments explaining:
  - Where to update the Square booking link.
  - Where to customize the translations in both English and Spanish.
  - Where to update image filenames to match the user’s actual uploaded files.
- Make sure that after generation, the site runs by simply opening index.html in the Replit preview.

Deliver the full code for:
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js

The final result should be:
- A complete, bilingual (EN/ES) static beauty salon website.
- Visually inspired by https://www.rikrak.com/ (layout, minimal style, hero, buttons, spacing).
- Ready to be hosted on Replit or GitHub Pages.
- Fully integrated with a Square booking link via simple anchor tags.
